## Abstract/Overview

_An estimated 2.3 million Americans live with limb loss, and 30% are affected by upper limb amputations. 185,000 amputations are performed in the U.S. annually, and around 6‚Äì7 out of every 10,000 births involve congenital upper limb differences. Despite technological advances, upper limb prosthetic abandonment remains widespread‚Äîranging from 24% to over 70%‚Äîlargely due to a lack of sensory feedback and the high cost of advanced devices. Existing feedback methods, such as targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR), are invasive, expensive, and often inaccessible. To address this, we developed a non-invasive, low-cost, and self-contained vibrotactile and thermal feedback device, PALM (Prosthetic Adaptive Limb Module), compatible with most upper limb prostheses. The system integrates thermistors, a Peltier module for thermal feedback, and a computer vision pipeline using an ESP32 camera and various embedded Image Feature Extraction algorithms for texture analysis. A Support Vector Regression model estimates surface roughness with near real-time responsiveness and maps it to a vibrotactile actuator for haptic output. All components are compact, lightweight, and collectively cost under $90. The device avoids surgical procedures and calibration-heavy systems, providing a scalable solution to enhance embodiment, reduce abandonment, and improve prosthesis functionality in daily use._
