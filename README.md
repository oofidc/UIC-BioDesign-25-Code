# NuTouch Code

UMN SURE: **Date to be Decided**, Likely around August 8th

Here's a set of steps I plan to go through to create a fully functional device between now and them:

**6/17 - 6/21**
- Clean Up GitHub Repository & Organize Software
    - Remove Unnecesary Random Images and Cpp/Python files not neccessary or productive to this Firmware in the future
    - Investigate Datasets sent by Rohan, evaluate ways to turn such information into training data for our model
    - Clean old Jupyter notebooks. Consider moving them to another GitHub Repository instead of one singular monorepo.
**6/21 - 6/22**
- Evaluate Hardware
    - Make sure new(longer) Camera cable isn't defective
    - Test Peltier Cooler & Heating Device
    - Discuss Redesign of thermal systems with Rohan
- Begin Exploratory Data Analysis & Model Preparations
    - Create new Streamlit Form for Continued Data Collection
    - Modify App for

## Project Organization
    - Figures+Animations contains all the figures and animations used in the project since the ISU HSRS competition,
    - notebooks has and will contain all the Jupyter notebooks used in the project which are not related to the creation of Figures
    - Nano-Code denotes code for the Nano, Camera-Code denotes code which should be uploaded to the ESP32.
    - Testing Files for now remain outside of any folder -- *however, this should be changed in th future*

This competition was really rushed and as a result the quality of this code is quite low. Since the professors offered to help us out in the future - It's assumed some modifications will have to be made to this code in order for it to be s
